AngularTimelineMongo
====================

This is a demonstration of how to quickly create a single page application with a RESTful API (ServiceStack) and Document database (MongoDB).

This started off as an investigation into Angular and MongoDB but I've been pretty wowed by ServiceStack so hopefully this demo demonstrates how easy ServiceStack is to use (and use in the 'right' way.

The application is very simple but hopefully is a clean starting point

Any feedback as to how I've used any of Angular, ServiceStack and MongoDB would be much appreciated.

Some outstanding issues:

Haven't been able to hook up validation (not sure why this isn't firing)
No tests (shame on me)
